# Empirical-Analysis-on-Jump-Statistics
Conducted research on clustering univariate scalar time series using the Jump Statistic, a novel method based on dendrogram jumps and AR-sieve bootstrapping. Compared performance with Silhouette and Gap Statistics using Monte Carlo simulations and real-world datasets (EDEN ISS, FRED-MD).
